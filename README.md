# HDRI-EAF-Technoeconomic-model
The repository contains python codes to model the HDRI-EAF based steelmaking process, which could be used to produce green steel in the future.
The Jupyter notebboks are stand alone but might require the installation of the following packages to run smoothly.
1. SALib (pip install SALib)
2. Installation of scipy, numpy, pandas. If you are using the Anaconda distribution, you would most likely have all these libraries already installed. 
3. These codes are published as part of a scientific journal submission. Link to the published article will be updated once the paper is accepted and a DOI is assigned. 
4. The codes will be modified with comments to explain the codes in detail in the future.
